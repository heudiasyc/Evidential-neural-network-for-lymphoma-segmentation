![ES-UNet Architecture](img/architecture.png?raw=true)

## Environment
Prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

## models 
Copy the models from ./models into ./monai/networks/net

## Data Preparation
- For experiments we used LYMPHOMA dataset.
- Users can can prapare their own dataset according and put the data into follow files 

- File structure
    ```
     LYMPHOMA
      |---Data
      |   |--- ct
      |   |   |--- AA001ct.nii...
      |   |--- pet
      |   |   |--- AA001pet.nii...
      |   |--- pet_mask
      |   |   |--- AA001mask.nii...

      |    |---TRAINING-RBF_(step1).py
      |    |---TRAINING-RBF_(step2).py
      |---pretrained_ckpt
      |---saved_model
      ...
    ```

## Pre-Trained Weights of UNET
- UNET: 
- Download UNet pre-trained weights of UNet and add it under ./pre-trained_model folder

## Pre-Trained Base Model For LYMPHOMA
- ENN-UNet: 
- Download ENN-UNet pre-trained model and add it under ./pre-trained_model folder

- RBF-UNet: 
- Download RBF-UNet pre-trained model and add it under ./pre-trained_model main folder




## Train/Test with random initialization
- Random initialization: Run the train script on LYMPHOMA Dataset end-to-end. 
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN.py
```

## Train/Test with k-means initialization  

- First run TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py to train the RBF/ENN layer only by fixing UNEt.
- Then run TRAINING-ENN_(step2).py to finetune the whole model with the pre-trained model on step 1.   
  -
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py
python TRAINING-ENN_(step2).py
```
