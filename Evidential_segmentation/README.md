![ES-UNet Architecture](img/architecture.png?raw=true)

## Environment
Prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

## models 
Copy the models from ./models into ./monai/networks/net

## Data Preparation
- For experiments we used LYMPHOMA dataset.
- Users can can prapare their own dataset according and put the data into follow files 

- File structure
    ```
     LYMPHOMA
      |---Data
      |   |--- ct
      |   |   |--- AA001ct.nii...
      |   |--- pet
      |   |   |--- AA001pet.nii...
      |   |--- pet_mask

      ...
    ```

## Pre-Trained Weights of UNET
- UNET: 
- Download UNet pre-trained weights of UNet and put it under ./pre-trained_model folder

## Pre-Trained Base Model For LYMPHOMA
- ENN-UNet: 
- Download ENN-UNet pre-trained model and put it under ./pre-trained_model folder

- RBF-UNet: 
- Download RBF-UNet pre-trained model and put it under ./pre-trained_model main folder




## Train UNet_ENN with random initialization (same for UNet_RBF)
- To train the whole model with random initialization, first, we need to pre-trained baseline model UNet. (Here we offer a pretrained UNet baseline model in ./pre-trained_model folder)
- Change to path to the pretrained baseline model Unet in TRAINING-ENN.py (line 116)
- Run the following code to train UNet_ENN. 
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN.py
```

## Train UNet_ENN_KMEANS with k-means initialization (same for UNet_RBF_KMEANS).
- To train the whole model with k-means initialization, first, we need to pre-trained baseline model UNet. (Here we offer a pretrained UNet baseline model in ./pre-trained_model/ folder)
_ Second we use the pre-trained UNet to calculate the initialize value of prototypes by k-means algorithom. (Here we offer a initialization value of prototypes that calculted by K-means, ./Center-kmeans.txt)
- Third run TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py to train the RBF/ENN layer only by fixing UNEt. 
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py
```
- Last run TRAINING-ENN_(step2).py to finetune the whole model with the pre-trained model on step 1.   

```bash
python TRAINING-ENN_(step2).py
```
