![ES-UNet Architecture](img/architecture.png?raw=true)

## Environment
Prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

## models 
Copy the models from ./models into ./monai/networks/net

## Data Preparation
- We used a 3D PET-CT LYMPHOMA dataset to test your model.
- Users can prepare their own dataset and put the data according to the following file structure:
- File structure
    ```
     LYMPHOMA
      |---Data
      |   |--- ct
      |   |   |--- AA001ct.nii...
      |   |--- pet
      |   |   |--- AA001pet.nii...
      |   |--- pet_mask

## Pre-Trained baseline model: UNET
- UNET: Download the pre-trained UNet model and put it under ./pre-trained_model folder

## Pre-Trained ENN_UNet and RBF-UNet
- ENN-UNet: Download the pre-trained ENN-UNet model and put it under ./pre-trained_model folder

- RBF-UNet: Download the pre-trained RBF-UNet model and put it under ./pre-trained_model main folder




## Train ENN_UNet with random initialization (same for RBF_UNet)
- First, we need to train a baseline model UNet. (Here, we offer a pre-trained UNet baseline model in ./pre-trained_model folder)
- Second, change to the path to the pre-trained baseline model UNet in TRAINING-ENN.py (line 116)
- Third, run the following code to train ENN_UNet. 
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN.py
```

## Train ENN_UNet_KMEANS with k-means initialization (same for RBF_UNet_KMEANS).
- First, we need to train a baseline model UNet. (Here, we offer a pre-trained UNet baseline model in ./pre-trained_model/ folder)
- Second, we use the pre-trained UNet to calculate the initialized value of prototypes by the k-means algorithm. (Here, we offer an initialization value of prototypes that are calculted by K-means, ./Center-kmeans.txt)
- Third, change to the path to the pre-trained baseline model UNet in TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py  (line 109)
- Fourth, run following code to train the ENN layer only by fixing UNet (activate lines 263-264 in une_enn_kmeans.py).
```bash
python TRAINING-ENN_(step1).py
```
- Last, run following code to finetune the whole model with the pre-trained model obtained from step 1 (deactivate lines 263-264 in une_enn_kmeans.py to disable gradient update for Unet).   

```bash
python TRAINING-ENN_(step2).py
```
